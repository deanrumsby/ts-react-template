# ts-react-template

A Typescript + React project template.

Uses:

- Vite: as the main development environment. This provides us with on demand file serving, fast Hot Module Replacement, optimised production building and out of the box support for TypeScript, CSS, JSX and more.

- ESLint: with AirBnB's very popular ruleset, to enforce a consistent code style.

- Vitest: A testing library that shares a similar API to Jest, but is compatible with Vite.

- Storybook: A UI development tool for component driven apps, allows us to isolate and test component behaviour through the use of stories.
